# Base2Tone Alacritty
DuoTone themes for [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) terminal

### Installation
Copy one of the colorscheme/config files in the `config/` folder to your `$HOME/.config/alacritty/` folder and rename it to `alacritty.yml`
One might have to edit some preferences in the config, like the value for font-family, which is a consequence of having the colors not separate from, but in the same file, as the rest of the config.
